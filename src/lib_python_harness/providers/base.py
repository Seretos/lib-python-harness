"""Provider-independent types: `Isolation`, `RunSpec`, `LaunchPlan`,
`RunResult`, and the `Provider` protocol every CLI adapter implements.

`ClaudeCliProvider` (`providers.claude_cli`), `CodexCliProvider`
(`providers.codex_cli`) and `MistralCliProvider` (`providers.mistral_cli`)
are the implementations; `RunSpec.provider` picks one
by name. A `Provider` carries its `name`, the `binary_argv` the harness
prepends at spawn time, and three responsibilities:

- `build_launch_plan(spec, session_id=..., run_dir=...)` — turn a `RunSpec`
  into an argv/cwd/env/stdin `LaunchPlan`, enforcing whatever isolation
  recipe its `Isolation` member implies.
- `parse_events(lines)` — turn the provider's own event stream (one JSON
  object per line for `ClaudeCliProvider`) into a `RunResult`.
- `build_resume_plan(provider_argv=..., session_id=..., cwd=..., prompt=...)`
  — turn a finished run's recorded argv into the plan for a follow-up turn on
  the same session (`Harness.resume`), replaying its isolation flags. A
  provider whose CLI cannot do that raises `UnsupportedByProvider`; an
  injected provider without the method is refused the same way.

What a further (e.g. Mistral) provider is explicitly *not* required to add to
this protocol (named per the plan-critic note that a blanket "anything else
is open" sentence documents no boundary at all):

- streaming/partial-output callbacks mid-run (`parse_events` is a one-shot,
  whole-stream parse; a provider may still emit partial events to disk, but
  nothing in this protocol subscribes to them as they arrive);
- non-JSON-lines event formats (`parse_events` takes `Iterable[str]`, one
  JSON object per line — a provider whose CLI emits something else must
  translate to that shape itself, outside this protocol);
- tool/plugin/MCP passthrough configuration (out of scope for `Isolation.CLEAN`
  by definition; a future non-CLEAN isolation profile would need a new
  `Isolation` member, not a `Provider` method);
- multi-turn conversation assembly (`RunSpec` carries exactly one `prompt`
  per call; a follow-up turn is a separate run, see `Harness.resume`).
